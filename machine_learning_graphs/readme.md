Here, we examine the effect of Camouflage on real world applications using machine learning and model based predictions. 
1) For the first we can use any images for enhancements.
2) For training Deep Learning model the flowers dataset from Kaggle.com has been used.
3) For running Object Detection we used a pre-trained yolo-v4 tiny model and provided videoes of our choice.
4) For training Multilabel Text classification a dataset from arxiv_data.csv was used that contains research paper titles, summaries and terms used.
5) For training Language LSTM an english-france translation dataset was used.
6) For training Synthetic GAN the fashion MNIST dataset was used.
7) For training Image Captioning the Flick8k dataset was used.
8) The trained model for Image Captioning generated in 7 was used for automated Image Caption generator.
9) Any classification dataset can be used to train Neural Network model.
10) Any classification dataset can be used to train K-Nearest Neighbor model.

Hence, to run the real_world_graphs you need to have all the datsets ready in the **extra** folder.
