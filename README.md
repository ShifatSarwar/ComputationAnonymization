# Comouflage
Research Project for Anonymizing Computation

The idea is to introduce fake nodes into existing computation nodes for deluding any ML algorithm from detecting
the currently executing process by a user.

# Run Method
Choose the scenario and run command in main.py

* Fake Node Addition Scenario

Automatically adds fake nodes to given algorithm, algorithm needs to be prepared as graphs with each node performing a simple computation or loop.

* Mixed Algorithm

Automatically combines 2-4 different algorithms into a single algorithm that executes in a linear manner or executes multiple nodes simultaneously using threads.

* Hybrid Version

Automatically combines 2-4 algorithms and adds fake nodes to create an excessive security measure that hides resource usage more efficiently.
